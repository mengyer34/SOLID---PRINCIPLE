## SRP - Single Responsibility Principle
  - ‚Äúa class should have only one reason to change‚Äù 
    which means every class should have a single responsibility
    or single job or single purpose.

## OCP - Open-Closed Principle
  - ‚Äúsoftware entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for 
  	extension, but closed for modification‚Äù which means you should be able to 
    extend a class behavior, without modifying it.

## LSP - Liskov Substitution Principle
  - ‚ÄúDerived or child classes must be substitutable for their base or parent classes‚Äú. 
    This principle ensures that any class that is the child of a parent class 
	  should be usable in place of its parent without any unexpected behavior.

## ISP - Interface Segregation Principle
  - ‚Äúdo not force any client to implement an interface which is irrelevant to them‚Äú. Here you should 
    prefer many client interfaces rather than one general interface and 
  	each interface should have a specific responsibility.

## DIP - Dependency Inversion Principle
  - High-level modules/classes should not depend on low-level modules/classes. Both should depend upon abstractions.
	  Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions.
